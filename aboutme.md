My name is Michael Domarkas. 

I play chess  
I run sometimes  
I like machine learning (esp. the maths behind it)  
and  
I think biology is cool.  

What else do you need?  

Well, I suppose I could give a more serious answer if you want a longer read.  

1. I'm interested in human cognition, biomolecular behaviour, mathematical rigour, modelling of complex systems and the intersectional space between the different sciences. I think the "goal" of life, outside of the daily enjoyment of experience, factors in some sort of higher-order pursuit, whether of an intellectual nature, or based in creative expression, or within the pedagogical support of others. I want to see a fruitful future for humanity, and also for the generation in which we currently reside: "the now" is vital to see "the later".  

3. I dabble in personal development, not too regimentedly but I run, I read and I enjoy my daily life. To be honest, it is mostly an intrinsic behaviour rather than something I try to keep track of but it is the backbone of my life. I spend a lot of time split across many areas: I play a lot of chess, read [LessWrong](https://lesswrong.com) , think about AI alignment and do a myriad of other leadership things within the communities I take part in.  

4. I want to make an impact on the world. Whether it's from an ML/ biochem/ maths/ neuroscience or some sort of combined perspective from these different areas. I think the concept of a [Pareto frontier](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XvN2QQpKTuEzgkZHY/being-the-pareto-best-in-the-world) is relatively useful, wherein combining experience across a range of areas is very powerful to access a problem space that others cannot as easily. Working on more than just hard problems - but problems that aren't being worked on - seems to be a powerful way to have outsized returns relative to W<sub>D</sub> (work done).
