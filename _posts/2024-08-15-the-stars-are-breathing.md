*I'd like to preface that I neither study English at A Level or otherwise practice traditional literary erudition within the scope of fiction and so my skill in writing has perhaps atrophied and therefore not produced significant fruits relative to the cornucopia of known and even unknown writers. Nevertheless, I'd like to share something of my own writing as I enjoy the process of weaving truth into literary tapestry, whether that be literal or emotional truth.*  


Wet grass dirtied my fleece but cleaned my heart. 

We were laying there waiting until I saw my first shooting star. I can never know if I had seen one before that moment but I definitively know I saw three that day, and he saw at least another three, *and what at the time felt comically many before me*. We lay there deep into the night in our shared solitude; while usually I may wish to interrupt my life with a camcorder to reminisce on the moment later, I knew then that I would not forget and let myself just sit there in our occasionally broken silence. Whatever I am, or whatever the soul is, my secular Ä€tman was there - open - to both the chirping crickets and the opportunity to be probed. We talked of the future: of the value of love, his girlfriend, how I was unsure about my future in college, how he had found his purpose only at some point around my age, the beauty of the stars, and laughing together in my exasperation at missing those few zipping across the sky that he so deftly identified and I could not. And eventually on the walk down, as the cold had finally crept in to the warmth of the moment, I finally elaborated on why the stars broke me. Tears fell on that hillside, with the lights of the manor house peaking out from a far trek away through the wet grass to the down below; the beauty of the sky can be just as painful as it is comforting.

Somewhere on the air, I can still smell those days now. It was only two weeks ago but those people that were around me for such a short time imprinted upon me more than I imagine people should. That great calm within some, observant eyes hiding deep thoughts across their glinting surfaces in others, and those midnight conversations whether under stars or on carpets shielding us from the cold wood panels: everything stays with me now locked away and fortified against the invasion of others, my own private world where my warmth now resides.
